span {

li {
    display: inline;
}

/* Block level elements have margin all over the element, but inline element only have left and right margins 
    We could override this by using 'display:inline-block;'*/

/* Also the top and bottom padding of inline elements collapse when they on top of each other(there would be no padding at all between them) 
    We could override this by using 'display:inline-block;', not issue mentioned below though it would now affect this element */

/* Also in Block level elements the top and bottom margins collapse too but in a different manner.
    as we imagine if the top element has a bottom-margin of 100 px and the bottom element has a top-margin of 120px, the margin between the two elements should be 220px, right?
    No you are wrong by default the margin collapses and the margin between them becomes the largest margin among the two elements. In this case 120px. 
    This is to be fixed when making the website fluid(for different sizes) */
